# üõ°Ô∏è Antivirus False Positive Notice

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Known Issue: Windows Defender Detection

If you're seeing a warning like:
- `Trojan:Script/Wacatac.B!ml`
- "This program is dangerous and executes commands from an attacker"
- Chrome blocking the download

**This is a FALSE POSITIVE** - your antivirus software is incorrectly flagging our legitimate application.

## üîç Why This Happens

GitFit.dev is built using PyInstaller, which packages Python applications into standalone executables. Unfortunately, this technique is also used by malware, causing antivirus software to flag legitimate applications.

**This is a well-known issue affecting many legitimate Python applications.**

   - A few may flag it due to PyInstaller (this is normal)

## üõ†Ô∏è For Developers

If you're building GitFit.dev from source, you can:

1. **Build it yourself** from the source code
2. **Use code signing** to prevent false positives:
   - Run `BUILD.bat` ‚Üí Option [S] for code signing setup
   - Purchase a code signing certificate (~$200-400/year)
   - Self-sign for personal use (users will see "Unknown Publisher")
